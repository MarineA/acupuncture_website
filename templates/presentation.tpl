ification Commission for Acupuncture and Oriental Medicine, and licensed by the Pennsylvania Medical Board. Brandy first became interested in acupuncture after seeing the quick, positive response in her performance horses that were treated with acupuncture.



Knowing that animals are incapable of being subject to a “placebo” effect, it was easy for Brandy to see that acupuncture truly does work. Brandy’s primary interests include pain management, emotional balancing and health maintenance. By understanding that the mind and body are connected, Brandy believes that a balanced and pain free body enables the mind to focus on day-to-day life with more clarity and a sense of well being.
